# based on instructions from https://www.startssl.com/?app=42

First, use the StartSSL™ Control Panel to create a private key and certificate and transfer them to your server. Then execute the following steps (if you use a class 2 certificate replace class1 by class2 in the instructions below):

Decrypt the private key by using the password you entered when you created your key:
openssl rsa -in ssl.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/ssl.key

Alternatively you can also use the Tool Box decryption tool of your StartSSL™ account.
Protect your key from prying eyes:

chmod 600 /etc/nginx/ssl/ssl.key

Fetch the Root CA and Class 1 Intermediate Server CA certificates:

wget http://www.startssl.com/certs/sub.class1.server.ca.pem

Create a unified certificate from your certificate and the CA certificates:

cat ssl.crt sub.class1.server.ca.pem > /etc/nginx/ssl/ssl-unified.crt

Configure your nginx server to use the new key and certificate (in the global settings or a server section):

    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/ssl-unified.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/ssl.key;

Tell nginx to reload its configuration:

killall -HUP nginx
